# FoodHub Business Intelligence & Data Analysis
### *Strategic Pivot: From Principal SDET to Machine Learning Engineering*

## 📌 Project Overview
The food aggregator industry thrives on logistics and customer satisfaction. This project involves a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the "FoodHub" dataset. As a Principal SDET transitioning into AI/ML, I have treated this data as a "Testable System" to uncover hidden patterns in demand, service latency, and customer sentiment.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- **Reliability Engineering:** Analyze preparation and delivery times to identify service-level bottlenecks.
- **Market Segmentation:** Group cuisines and restaurants by popularity and revenue contribution.
- **Quality Assurance:** Correlate user ratings with order costs and delivery speeds to enhance retention.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** - **Pandas/NumPy:** Data validation, cleaning, and transformation.
    - **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Advanced statistical visualization (Univariate & Bivariate).
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / HTML Export.


## 🔍 Key Analysis & Findings
Based on the data profiling conducted in the notebook:

### 1. The "Pareto" Effect in Restaurants
A small segment of restaurant partners drives the majority of the platform's volume. **Shake Shack, The Meatball Shop, Blue Ribbon Sushi, and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken** are the core pillars of the current business model.

### 2. Operational Latency
Analysis revealed that weekend delivery times are significantly higher than weekdays. This suggests a need for dynamic delivery partner allocation to maintain SLAs.

### 3. Revenue vs. Satisfaction
- **American and Japanese** cuisines lead in volume.
- **French Cuisine** represents a "Premium" opportunity: it has high costs but consistently high customer satisfaction, making it ideal for luxury branding.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations
- **Promotional Focus:** Target the "Big Four" restaurants for loyalty programs to drive acquisition.
- **App Enhancement:** As an SDET, I identified that "Rating" data is currently too vague. I recommend updating the app UI to prompt for specific feedback (Food Quality vs. Delivery Speed) to generate cleaner data for future predictive models.
- **Logistics:** Address specific restaurant partners with high preparation times to improve overall system throughput.
